# Overview 
A freelance website that allows users to design and purchase virtual business cards. 

Built with a sleek and modern design, I worked closely with the client to ensure their vision was realised. A part of the requirements was to create a form that users can use to create a sample business card so they can see a preview of the functionality before purchasing.

The site also includes integration with stripe so users can purchase cards if they want.
