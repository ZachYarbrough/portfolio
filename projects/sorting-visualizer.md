# Overview

The Sorting Visualizer is an interactive React-based web app that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work in real time. It supports selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, insertion sort, and bubble sort, letting users see how arrays transform step by step as each algorithm runs.

The visualizer features a retro CRT-inspired design, making the experience engaging and distinctive. Users can adjust the sorting speed on the fly, reset the graph smoothly, and experiment with different algorithms without interruptions.
