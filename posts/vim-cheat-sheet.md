A vim motion consists of three parts:
- **command** the
- **count** the number of times to perform the motion (i.e. '5', '3')
- **motion** the type of motion (i.e. 'w', 'b')

### Basic Movement

'w' - move to the next word
'b' - move to the previous word
'e' - move to the end of the word
'0' - move to the beginning of the line

You can use the numbers to move to the nth word or line.

i.e. '5w' - move to the 5th word
