I have recently been spending a lot of time thinking about time -- no pun intended. I am in the process of creating a calendar for the project I am working on at my day job and I also have been working with dates a lot on my side projects. I have been thinking a lot about how javscript handles time and so I thought I would write a post about it to cement my understanding.
