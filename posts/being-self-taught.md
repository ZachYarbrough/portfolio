As a self-taught developer, my journey into programming has been both challenging and rewarding. Unlike traditional paths through computer science degrees, I've had to forge my own curriculum, carefully selecting resources and projects that would help me grow. This self-directed approach has taught me not just programming concepts, but also valuable skills like problem-solving, self-motivation, and the ability to learn independently. While it can sometimes feel overwhelming to navigate the vast ocean of programming knowledge without a formal roadmap, the freedom to focus on what interests me most has kept me passionate and engaged. Through online courses, documentation, open source projects, and countless hours of practice, I've built a foundation that continues to grow with each new challenge I tackle.

```js
console.log('Hello World')
const x = 1
const doMath = (x: any) => {
  return x * 2
}

console.log(doMath(x))```

This is an example of some code blocks for .md files.

```python
print('Hello World')
x = 1
def doMath(x):
  return x * 2

print(doMath(x))```

```bash
$ echo 'Hello World'```
```js
console.log('Hello World')```
```js
console.log('Hello World')

console.log('Hello World')```

More testing includes:

- [x] Fix single line code block styling
- [x] Get secondary css variable working
- [ ] Allow Table of Contents to be sticky
- [ ] Implement Table of Contents clickable links
- [ ] Implement on scroll color change for table of content headers
    - i.e. when you scroll down the page, the content color changes as you scroll past
