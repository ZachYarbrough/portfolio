> 'Sucksng at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something.' - Jake the Dog, Adventure Time

This quote perfectly encapsulates the mentality I try to have when working on side projects and exploring unfamiliar topics. I don't want to shy away from projects and technologies that I lack experience with. I want to be able to write about topics I am not an expert in. I don't want to hide my failures and mistakes. My hope with this mindset is that it will remove any fear of failure and foster a growth mindset. I want this blog to be a place where I can share my journey as a developer and document smaller side-projects that don't fit in the [projects](projects/) section of my portfolio.

# Goals
I recently felt inspired to create this blog as a way of documenting my journey as a developer. I want this project to serve as a personal knowledge base where I can store information I've learned and reference it in the future. Some of my goals in creating this blog are to streamline my learning process and improve my technical writing skills. I wanted to make this a public blog to hopefully increase accountability. While this blog is primarily for my own benefit, I would love it if others find value in posts here too!

I'm not going to try and stick to any schedule or posting cadence. I want to keep this side project as enjoyable as possible and the last thing I want is for this blog to feel like work. Depending on my motivation and what projects I am working on, I will post more or less frequently. Some months life will get busy or I will get distracted with a new video game/tv show.

Last but not least, I figured this blog would be a fun outlit for me to reflect on challenges and go down rabbit holes on topics I find interesting.

# Content
Here are some examples of content I plan to write about. This is not an exhaustive list, just some ideas I have.

### Project Dev Blogs
I plan to write development blog posts for bigger projects that I am working on. If the project is less than a month long and I didn't encounter any unique challenges, I probably won't write about it during development.

### Project Reviews
I want review posts to be a way for me to reflect on the project and what I learned from it. Ideally I will create a post for each project I work on. I will also create a template for this type of post and evolve it as I write more project reviews.

### Technical Deep Dives
Any tools, concepts, or technologies that I want to understand better, I will write a technical deep dive post about it.

### (Not so Technical) Deep Dives
I want to seperate deep dives into two categories. This category will be for deep dives on topics that I find interesting, but don't pertain to software development. This could be anything from a new book I am reading, to a part of history I want to learn more about.

### Tutorials
I plan to write tutorials for issues I encounter while working on projects. My hope is that creating tutorials for topics that I have trouble grasping will deepen my understanding of the topic.
