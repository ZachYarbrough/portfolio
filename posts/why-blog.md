> 'Sucking at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something.' - Jake the Dog

This quote has stuck with me since I first heard it as a kid. It’s the perfect reminder that getting better at something takes time, especially when learning to code. As a software developer, you have to be willing to constantly adapt to new technologies and concepts. The tech world seems to churn out new libraries and tools every day, who knows where innovation will take us? Maybe one day we’ll be coding telepathically, accidentally pushing half-baked features straight from our dreams into production… I’m joking (right?).

Keeping track of what I’m learning and the challenges I face has always helped me improve, which is part of why I decided to start this blog. It’s a space for me to track my progress, reflect on lessons learned, and solidify my understanding of concepts and technologies in an ever-changing industry that moves at lightning speed. Along the way, I also hope to sharpen my technical writing skills and make my learning process more efficient. I’ve made this blog public for a bit of accountability, and while it’s primarily for my own growth, I’d love for others to find value in my posts as well.

I’m not setting a strict posting schedule. The moment blogging feels like a chore, I know I’ll lose motivation. How often I post will depend on my free time, my day job, and whatever projects I’m working on. Some months will be busy, while others I might get lost in a video game or binge a TV show. 

Ultimately, I see this blog as a fun space to reflect on challenges, explore interesting topics, and occasionally dive down rabbit holes.

# Content Ideas

Here are some examples of the kind of posts I plan to write. This isn’t an exhaustive list, just a snapshot of my ideas:

### Technical Deep Dives
I say 'deep dive' very loosely here. These posts will explore technologies and concepts I want to understand in more depth.

### Project Reviews
After finishing a project, I find it helpful to step back and reflect. I’ll write reviews or retrospectives to distill lessons learned and highlight successes during development.

### Showcases
While there is already a dedicated [projects](/projects) section in my portfolio, smaller posts give me a chance to showcase work that isn’t big enough for its own page. This could be anything from a handy bash script that saves me time, to a half-finished side project I want to talk about.

I’m excited to share this journey and hope you’ll find something here that sparks curiosity, inspires a project, or just makes you think differently about coding and learning.
