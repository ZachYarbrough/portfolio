> 'Sucking at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something.' - Jake the Dog

This quote has stuck with me since I first heard it as a kid. It’s the perfect reminder that getting better at something takes time — especially when learning to code. As a software developer, you have to be willing to constantly adapt to new technologies and concepts. The tech world seems to churn out new libraries and tools every day — who knows where innovation will take us? Maybe one day we’ll be coding telepathically, accidentally pushing half-baked features straight from our dreams into production… I’m joking (right?).

Part of the reason I started this blog is to track my progress, reflect on challenges, and solidify my understanding of concepts and technologies in an ever-changing industry that moves at lightning speed. Along the way, I also hope to sharpen my technical writing skills and make my learning process more efficient. I’ve made this blog public for a bit of accountability, and while it’s primarily for my own growth, I’d love for others to find value in my posts as well.

I’m not setting a strict posting schedule. The moment blogging feels like a chore, I know I’ll lose motivation. How often I post will depend on my free time, my day job, and whatever projects I’m working on. Some months will be busy; others, I might get lost in a video game or binge a TV show.

Ultimately, I see this blog as a fun space to reflect on challenges, explore interesting topics, and occasionally dive down rabbit holes.

# Content Ideas

Here are some examples of the kind of posts I plan to write. This isn’t an exhaustive list — just a snapshot of my ideas:

### Technical Deep Dives
I say 'deep dive' very loosely here. These posts will explore technologies and concepts I want to understand in more depth.

### Project Reviews
After finishing a project, I find it helpful to step back and reflect. I’ll write reviews or retrospectives to distill lessons learned and highlight successes.

### Showcases
While there is already a dedicated [projects](/projects) section in my portfolio, smaller posts give me a chance to showcase work that isn’t big enough for its own page. This could be anything from a handy bash script that saves me time, to a half-finished side project I want to talk about.
