# Goals
I've recently been inspired to start this blog so I can document my development journey and create a database full of lessons I've learned and projects I'm working on. My hope is that creating this blog will help me learn more effectively while at the same time creating a resource for me to refer back to. This blog is for myself, but if other's find it useful in the future, that's great! I don't plan on keeping to a specific schedule or format (I don't want to get burned out or start to dread writing). Instead I want this to be a fun way of retaining information. Another hope I have for starting this blog is that it will give me a sense of accountability to keep learning and growing.
