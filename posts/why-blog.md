> 'Sucking at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something.' - Jake the Dog

The quote above has stuck in my mind since I first heard it as a kid. I now find it perfectly encapsulates the growth mindset I want to build while learning how to code. As a software developer, you have to be willing to constantly adapt to new technologies and concepts. The tech field seemingly improves with new libraries and tools daily. Who knows where innovation will take us — maybe in a few years we’ll be coding telepathically, accidentally pushing half-baked features straight from our dreams into production -- only time will tell. I'm joking obviously (or am I?), but this is part of the reason why I decided to start this blog -- to track my progress, reflect on challenges, and solidify my understanding of concepts and technologies in an ever-changing industry that is evolving at the speed of light. 

Along the way, I also hope to refine my technical writing skills and streamline my learning process. I decided to make this a public blog to add a bit of accountability. While it’s primarily for my own growth, I’d love for others to find value in my posts as well!

I don't plan on setting a strict schedule or posting cadence - the moment this begins to feel like work, I know I will lose motivation. How often I post will depend on my free time outside of my day job and whatever projects I’m working on at the time. Some months I’ll be more active, while others I might get caught up in the chaos of life, get lost in a new video game, or just binge a TV show.

I see this blog as a fun space to reflect on challenges, explore interesting topics, and dive into the occasional rabbit hole.

# Content

Here are some examples of content I plan to make posts about. This is not an exhaustive list, just some ideas I have.

### Technical Deep Dives
I say 'deep dive' very loosely here, I plan on writing posts about technologies and concepts that I want to learn more in depth.

### Project Reviews
After finishing a project, I think it is beneficial to take a step back and reflect on successes and lessons learned. I want to write reviews or retrospectives for my projects so I can condense my takeaways in a digestible way.

### Showcases
I already have a dedicated [projects](/projects) section in my portfolio where I showcase my projects, but creating smaller posts presents an opportunity for me to highlight projects I am working on that aren't big enough to have a dedicated project page. This could be anything from a random bash script that saves me time, to a project I want to talk about, but I never finished.
