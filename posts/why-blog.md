# Goals
I recently felt inspired to create this blog as a way of documenting my journey as a developer. I want this project to serve as a personal knowledge base where I can store information I've learned and reference it in the future. Some of my goals in creating this blog are to streamline my learning process and improve my technical writing skills. I wanted to make this a public blog to hopefully increase accountability. While this blog is primarily for my own benefit, I would love it if others find value in posts here too!

I'm not going to try and stick to any schedule or posting cadence. I want to keep this side project as enjoyable as possible and I don't want to turn this blog into work. Depending on my motivation and what projects I am working on, I will post more or less frequently. Some months life will get busy or I will get distracted with a new video game/tv show.

Last but not least, I figured this blog would be a fun outlit to reflect on challenges and to document rabbit holes I go down.

# Content
Here are some examples of content I plan to write about. This is not an exhaustive list, just some ideas I have.

### Project Dev Blogs
I plan to write development blog posts for bigger projects that I am working on. If the project is less than a month long and I didn't encounter any unique challenges, I probably won't write about it unless I make a project retrospective about it.

### Project Retrospectives
I want retrospective posts to be a way for me to reflect on the project and what I learned from it. Ideally I will create a post for each project I work on. I will also create a template for this type of post and evolve it as I write more retrospective posts.

### Technical Deep Dives
Any tools, concepts, or technologies that I want to understand better, I will write a technical deep dive post about it.

### Thoughts on Software Development
I am not sure how often I will write about my opinions on the software development industry as I'm still a junior developer. But if there is something in the back of my mind or that I just want to get off my chest, I will write about it.
