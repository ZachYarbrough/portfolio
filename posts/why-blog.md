The quote above is one of my favorites, it perfectly encapsulates the growth mindset I am trying to embrace in my development journey. As a software developer, you have to be willing to adapt to new technologies and concepts. The field is constantly evolving, who knows maybe one day we will all be coding on quantum computers and riding around in flying Teslas, only time will tell. This is part of the reason that I decided to start this blog - to track my progress, reflect on challenges, and solidify my understanding of concepts and technologies. 

Along the way, I also hope to refine my technical writing skills and streamline my learning process. I decided to make this a public blog to add a bit of accountability. While it’s primarily for my own growth, I’d love for others to find value in my posts as well!

I don't plan on setting a strict schedule or posting cadence - the moment this begins to feel like work, I know I will lose motivation. How often I post will depend on my free time outside of my day job and whatever projects I’m working on at the time. Some months I’ll be more active, while others I might get caught up in the chaos of life, get lost in a new video game, or just binge a TV show.

I see this blog as a fun space to reflect on challenges, explore interesting topics, and dive into the occasional rabbit hole.

# Content

Here are some examples of content I plan to make posts about. This is not an exhaustive list, just some ideas I have.

### Technical Deep Dives
I say 'deep dive' very loosely here, I plan on writing posts about technologies and concepts that I want to learn more in depth.

### (Not So) Technical Deep Dives
Even though posts will be technical for the most part, I still want to allow myself to go down random rabbit holes I find interesting and write about them. Again, this blog is meant to be a fun hobby, anything could ultimately become a post if I have enough interest in the topic. (I have been reading a lot about [The Condor Cluster](https://phys.org/news/2010-12-air-playstation-3s-supercomputer.html) recently which could be a good first topic)

### Project Reviews
After finishing a project, I think it is beneficial to take a step back and reflect on successes and lessons learned. I want to write reviews or retrospectives for my projects so I can condense my takeaways in a digestible way.

### Showcases
I already have a dedicated [projects](/projects) section in my portfolio where I showcase my projects, but creating smaller posts presents an opportunity for me to highlight projects I am working on that aren't big enough to have a dedicated project page. This could be anything from a random bash script that saves me time, to a project I want to talk about, but I never finished.
