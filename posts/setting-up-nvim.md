> I used [The Primeagen's](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen(ThePrimeagen)) video as a tutorial on setting up my initial config.

For the below commands and setup, I will assume that you are in a neovim editor.


To see the dtirectory that neovim will look on your decive, type the below command.
```
:h rtp```

In order to create a new file, use the '%' sign.
```
%[file-name-here]```


**:so** - sources the current file you are editting
