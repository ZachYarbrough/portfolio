> This post will work as a template for future retrospective posts. I want to keep evolving the document for each new project I work on.

I mentioned briefly in the [Why Blog](why-blog.md) post I made that I was going to do a retrospective of the blog itself.

I also wanted to use this opportunity to learn more about markdown and creating a visually pleasing editor that is easy for my personal use case.
