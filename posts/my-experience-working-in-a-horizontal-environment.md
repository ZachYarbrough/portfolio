I recently closed my first chapter in the industry after spending three years working as a full stack developer at a company with a horizontal structure. As a relatively new developer, it turned out to be an ideal environment for growth. I was exposed to a wide range of concepts and implementations, my ideas were welcomed, and I was able to put them into practice without heavy process overhead.

In this post, I want to share some of my key takeaways from working in a horizontal structured environment. What worked well, what was challenging, and why I think it can be a valuable setup for developers early in their career. 

# Ownership is Real

The first point I wanted to talk about is the idea of ownership. On each software that I worked on, I was always able to develop major features for the proejct. Whether it was an internal notification system, the client-side caching system, or the primary workflow implementation, there was always a lot of responsibility. This created some stress and high-pressure situations, but looking back on the process it taught me a ton.

I quickly became the primary developer for certain features and was very familiar with the code-base. This allowed me to fully understand how a feature needed to be built end-to-end and gave me a lot of exposure to the entire development process.

# Communication Matters

In a horizontal structured team, communication wasn't optional, it was foundational. Beyond daily stand-ups, staying aligned on what was being built across the product and what issues might affect ongoing work was critical. Our teams were often fully remote and spread across time zones, which made availability and flexibility key.

Because the company was small, developers were often pulled onto different projects as priorities shifted. That made it essential to stay up to date on each other's work and maintain a baseline understanding of how and why certain features were implemented. I was frequently asked to fix bugs or extend features I hadn't originally built, often because the original developer was already focused on another project.

# Standards Must Be Enforced

Strong communication only works if the codebase itself is consistent. It was vital the developers were on the same page throughout the implementation of a project regarding the overall structure and what coding practices should be enforced. Tools like ESLint helped a bit enforce syntactical consistency, but the overall coding structure was also important. For example, naming conventions, file structure, and consistent use of hooks had a major impact on readability and long-term maintainability.

These standards were mentioned by our leads, but it was up to us to enforce them and flag PRs if the code didn't meet the standard. This also ties back to communication and keeping a good relationship with your fellow developers in order to stay on the same page with what and how we are implementing the code so we didn't build functions that already existed elsewhere or were not necessary.

# Your Impact is Visible

One of the most meaningful aspects of working in a horizontally structured team is that your contributions are tangible and clearly felt. On smaller teams, the features you build are often core to the product and used daily by real customers. That visibility creates a strong since of pride, but also raises the bar. If a feature isn't well designed or performant, the impact is immediate and the entire product feels it.

Looking back on my time developing these systems, I'm proud of the role I played in their success. I gained an enormous amount of experience through hands-on problem solving, trial and error, and direct responsibility for what shipped to production. I don't think I would have had the same level of exposure in a more rigid, hierarchical environment.

For developers early in their careers, I'd encourage you not to shy away from smaller companies or flatter team structures. The autonomy, visibility, and responsibility can be challenging, but they may also be one of the fastest ways to grow both your technical skills and your confidence as a developer.
