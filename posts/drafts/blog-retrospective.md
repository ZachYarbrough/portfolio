I mentioned briefly in the [Why Blog](posts/why-blog.md) post that I was going to do a retrospective of the blog itself once I got it up and running.

The main inspiration I found for creating this blog was [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz), a site generator that uses markdown to create static sites. I really enjoyed how intuitive navigation was, so I tried to implement a similar design.

I also wanted to use this opportunity to learn more about markdown and creating a visually pleasing editor that is easy for my personal use case.
